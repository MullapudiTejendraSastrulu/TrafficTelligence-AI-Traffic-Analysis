The system uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) as the primary object detection model due to its excellent balance of speed and accuracy for real-time applications. YOLOv8 is a single-stage object detector that processes the entire image in one forward pass, making it suitable for real-time video analysis.

2.2 YOLOv8 Implementation

• Model Architecture: YOLOv8n (nano) for edge deployments, YOLOv8m (medium) for cloud deployments
• Input Resolution: 640x640 pixels (standard), with dynamic resizing based on video source
• Pre-trained Weights: Initial deployment uses weights pre-trained on COCO dataset
• Fine-tuning: Model fine-tuned on custom traffic dataset for improved accuracy

2.3 Vehicle Classification

The system classifies detected vehicles into the following categories:
• Passenger Car
• SUV/Pickup
• Bus
• Truck (Light/Medium/Heavy)
• Motorcycle
• Bicycle
• Other

Classification is achieved through:
• Primary classification from YOLOv8 detection classes
• Secondary verification using image features within bounding boxes
• Confidence thresholds to minimize misclassification
